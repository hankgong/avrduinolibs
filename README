Arduino is a great project, which let many non-professional programmer enjoy 
embedded programming. Most of its source code are provided as C++, which is 
not neccessary in real applications writing.

In this project, I would like to practice the following things..

1) Learn to write the project building system with cmake scripts

2) Rewrite and test the important CPP library to C library for effeciency...

3) Emulated thread prgramming 

4) Realtime OS for MCU: freertos or femtoos
